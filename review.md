[Humanizing Peer Reviews](https://www.processimpact.com/articles/humanizing_reviews.pdf):

Working together:
* "Peer review—an activity in which people other than the author of a software deliverableexamine it for defects and improvement opportunities—is one of the most powerful softwarequality tools available."
* "Many of the barriers to successful peer reviews are social and cultural in nature, not technical."
* "Asking your colleagues to point out errors in your work is a learned—not instinctive—behavior. ... Holding successful peer reviews requires us to overcome this naturalresistance to outside critique of our work."
* "Egoless programming enables an author to step back and let others point outplaces where improvement is needed."
* "Having a co-worker locate a defect is regarded as a “good catch,” not a personal failing."

Tips for reviewers:
* "The ways in which reviewers speak to authors indicate whether their culture favors respectful collaborationor competitive antagonism."
* "Bugsare the bad guys in a review, not the author or the reviewers."
* "The leaders of the review initiativeshould strive to create a culture of constructive criticism, in which team members seek to learnfrom their peers and do a better job the next time."
