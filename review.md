[Humanizing Peer Reviews](https://www.processimpact.com/articles/humanizing_reviews.pdf):

"We have to overcome the ingrained culture ofindividual achievement and embrace the value of collaboration."

# Working together:
* "Peer review—an activity in which people other than the author of a software deliverableexamine it for defects and improvement opportunities—is one of the most powerful softwarequality tools available."
* "Many of the barriers to successful peer reviews are social and cultural in nature, not technical."
* "Asking your colleagues to point out errors in your work is a learned—not instinctive—behavior. ... Holding successful peer reviews requires us to overcome this naturalresistance to outside critique of our work."
* "Egoless programming enables an author to step back and let others point outplaces where improvement is needed."
* "Having a co-worker locate a defect is regarded as a “good catch,” not a personal failing."

# Tips for reviewers:
* "The ways in which reviewers speak to authors indicate whether their culture favors respectful collaborationor competitive antagonism."
* "Bugsare the bad guys in a review, not the author or the reviewers."
* "The leaders of the review initiativeshould strive to create a culture of constructive criticism, in which team members seek to learnfrom their peers and do a better job the next time."

# Barriers:
* "Some developers and project managersdon’t think their project is large enough or critical enough to need reviews, yet any piece of workcan benefit from an outside perspective."
* "The fear of managementretribution if defects are discovered can make an author reluctant to let others examine his work."
* "There’s an implication that ifyou need help, then you must not be very smart. Therefore, it’s not surprising that developersoften resist asking for help through reviews."
* "People who don’t want to do reviews will expendconsiderable energy explaining why reviews don’t fit their culture, needs, or time constraints."

# Overcoming resistence:
* "Lack of knowledge is easy to correct if people are willing to learn."
* "The attitudes and behaviors that managers exhibit affect how well reviews will work inan organization."
